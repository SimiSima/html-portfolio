<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi Guys! My name is Gulsim, just call me Sima. I am from Kazakhstan, a monh from 29 years old girl who loves traveling.
  I have a boyfriend, Kia Soul and a cat named "Meatpie". I am the youngest child, which gives me privilage not to fulfill my parents' expectations.
  That's why I am here today sharing stories from endless travels.
</p>

<p>  I want to share my experience and stories somewhere out there, so you can read it and find useful or interesting things.
Also I would share my knowledge for traveling on a budjet. It would be relevant only for people where I travel from. But places to stay, eat and shop would be helpful for all. 
</p>

<p>Thank you for spending your time here. 
  See you,
  Love and respect, 
  Sima
